           Ensembling Random forest
       Random Forest is an algorithm that is used for both regression and classification tasks
       from the regression made in insurance company and churn modelling,the final predictions of all predictions 
       is made by aggregating the predictions of all individual decisions.
       
       In the diagram,random forest is made up of multiple decision trees.Each decision tree is trained on a subset
       of the features.once the trees are trained they can be used to make predictions on new data in the testing phase.
       when new data is presented to the random forest,it is passed down and the prediction is made at each node based 
       on the features in the subset.
       in the end the prediction from all the decision trees are aggregated to make a final prediction.
       
             conclusion
             Random forest algorithm is an effective way to leverage the power of decision trees and create a more accurate 
             machine learning model.
